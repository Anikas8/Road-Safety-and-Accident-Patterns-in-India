# Road-Safety-and-Accident-Patterns-in-India
 The goal of this project is to increase road safety in India by identifying high-risk regions and analyzing accident patterns using Qlik's data analytics platform. Through the integration of many data sources, including traffic data, accident reports, meteorological data, road infrastructure, and demographic information, the 		project aims to detect patterns, pinpoint locations where accidents occur frequently, and forecast future incidents. In order to improve safety precautions	and lower accident rates, these insights will support data-driven decision-making	by government bodies, transportation agencies, and road safety groups.
